# oilspill-detection-using-Deep-Learning

What I have done in this project:
1. We trained a model using CNN (pytorch) using google colab, link of notebook : 
https://github.com/shubhamatkal/oil-spill-detection-iusing-deep-learning/blob/main/python%20notebook%20for%20training%20model/Oilspills_Detection_Model.ipynb

3. Using following dataset (500 images of oil spills from Instagram using web scraping):

4. Link for trained model: https://github.com/shubhamatkal/oil-spill-detection-iusing-deep-learning/blob/main/model/spill.pth

5. Application created using flask for interacting with model :
